  <h1>Head Up Display</h1>
  <p>A Sonification Lab Project</p>
  <p>While driving a car, it is crucial to focus on the road in order to drive safely. However, vehicle drivers usually need to perform many tasks while driving, some tasks require eyes remove from the road, such as reading current speed from the dashboard or turn down the radio. Lack of visual attention on the road may increase the risk of traffic accidents. Head-Up Displays show a graphical user interface overlay within the limited lower windshield area. By presenting information on a HUD, drivers are able to maintain visually focus on road ahead, leading to improvements in driver’s task performance as well as safety </p>

  <h3>Project Background</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>HUD displays due to being limited in size, often present spatially dissociated information, drivers have to search for the hazard or event causing the sign. Windshield Displays (WSDs) however, by virtue of being spread across the windshield allow warning signs to be displayed at the position of the hazard</li>
    <li>While HUDs can help improve driver’s task performance while they are driving, according to past researches, many attributes of the virtual elements presented by HUD may significantly affect driver’s performance. These factors include the distance between the virtual elements and the driver in the visual interface, the location of the image, the formats of the image (landmark-based information or conventional distance-to-turn information), and the driver’s psychological feelings of the presented information</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The following factors affect the Driver's performance</p>
  <ul>
  <li>Position of the HUD image, position of the HUD warning</li>
  <li>Design of the image, aesthetics and the look-and-feel</li>
  <li>Driver age</li>
  </ul>
  <h3>Eco Driving</h3>
  <p>In-Vehicle Displays (IVDs) have the potential to reduce fuel consumption rates (FCR), thus reducing emissions from in-use vehicles. Fuel Conservation and Fuel Efficiency of automobiles is a globally relevant issue and HUDs can play a major role in informing the driver about driving inefficiencies</p>
  <h3>Open Questions</h3>
  <p>There is a plethora of literature on HUD and we gain a lot of insight by going through the conclusions and insights of researchers before us. However a lot remains to be answered. Might the benefits of HUD be due to mere ‘novelty factor’? What level of training is required for a driver to use a HUD effectively? The perfect location of the HUD is a matter of great importance and has been well debated in literature. HUD displays off by a few degrees from the optimal can render them useless, worse, distracting and harmful. So what really is the perfect HUD location? If people of different ages use HUD differently, will it not be a good idea to design HUDs that can adapt according to the user’s age? </p>

  <h3>Our goals</h3>
  </ul>
  <ul>
  <li>Maintain and enhance the HUD Designer to simulate various tests and use cases so that we get a feel for what the HUD of the future should look like</li>
  <li>Add Eco-Driving features to the existing project</li>
  </ul>
